# Development guide

## Principles for development

### Code quality first

To maintain the highest quality standard, all code must be reviewed before merging into the main branch. High-quality code is:

- **Readable**: Clear, well-structured, and easy to understand for any developer.
- **Maintainable**: Designed for easy modification, extension, and debugging.
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles increasing complexity and load.
- **Performant**: Avoids unnecessary computations, ensuring responsiveness.
- **Secure**: Free from known vulnerabilities, following best security practices.
- **Tested**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and, where applicable, E2E tests.

### Code quality practices

- **Code reviews**: Every code change must undergo peer review to ensure best practices.
- **Frequent refactoring**: Code should be continuously improved to remove technical debt.
- **Automated code checks**: Linting, static analysis, and CI/CD pipelines must enforce consistency.
- **Documentation**: Critical parts of the system must be documented, either through inline comments or external documentation.
- **Consistency**: Follow agreed-upon coding standards and architectural principles.

### UI/UX quality first

We prioritize user experience by adhering to the NG-Zorro design system, ensuring a cohesive, intuitive, high-quality interface.

### UI/UX principles

- **Design system compliance**: Follow NG-Zorro guidelines to maintain design consistency.
- **Interaction**: Ensure seamless, intuitive, and predictable user interactions.
- **Spacing**: Maintain adequate margins, paddings, and whitespace to enhance readability and usability.
- **Consistency**: Use standardized UI components, typography, and layout structures.
- **Structure**: Organize information hierarchically for clarity and easy navigation.
- **Simplicity**: Keep interfaces clean, avoid unnecessary elements, and focus on essential functionality.
- **Visibility**: Ensure important actions and information are easily discoverable.
- **Typography**: Use clear, legible fonts with appropriate sizing and hierarchy.
- **Copywriting**: Write concise, user-friendly, and action-driven text in the UI.
- **Color**: Adhere to the NG-Zorro color scheme for accessibility and visual harmony.
- **Reusability**: Build modular components that can be reused across multiple screens.
- **Devices and media**: Ensure responsiveness and adaptability across different screen sizes and devices.
